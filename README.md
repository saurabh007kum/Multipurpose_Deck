## Objectvie

The project Multipurpose Deck (A Tourism web portal) is a GUI based automated system, 
which will cover all the information related to the all tourism based information which a 
tourist need. For example – Hotels, Visiting Places, Shopping Malls, and many more. If a 
tourist came first time to visit the city and he had no enough information about that city then 
he can get help through our web portal. Because of I have made the collection of various 
kinds of resources keeping in the mind the thing that a tourist needs. For example if the tourist 
came in the city then his first need is to stay in a “Hotel” , so we have categorize a list which 
is containing one of the best hotels of the city and they are well suited according to the 
budget also , so the tourist doesn’t need to ask to someone or wander everywhere. As I have 
said that the objective of this project is to fulfill all the requirements of a tourist which he 
wants in that city. So I have provided all the resources (that a tourist wants) on the web in a 
single place, so he doesn’t need to search everything separately for each of his need, he just 
have to do one thing is that he have to came on our website and that’s it. All the 
requirements will be satisfied at one place. So by this GUI based automated web portal if a 
user wants the information about a particular place or something else, then he can get it just in 
a click.
